# ConsoleApplication-CPP-20
Visual Studio 2022 C++ 20 standard console application. Separate declaration (inc) and definition (src) folders, as well as a separate precompiled header (pch) folder.

Download the code in the usual way and unzip the folder to the Visual Studio template folder in Documents\Visual Studio 2022. 
Place it where it will get picked up by Visual Studio. This is usually at the root of the Templates/Project Templates folder - unless you have directed VS 2022 to utilise one of either Visual C++ or Visual C++ Project.
